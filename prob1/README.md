Two major classes:  Node and Tree

Two major functions:  find_next_node and move_nodes

Find_next_node decides what to do with the tree in the current state.
Move nodes permutes the tree from one state to another depending on what comes out of find_next_node.

Node.print() is a bit wonky, but works.
